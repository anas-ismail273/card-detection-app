I want to have a web app for this project. The web app and the flow should be as follows:

First Flow:
- When the user opens the app, they should be able to upload an image (which may contain a single card, multiple cards, etc.).
- After uploading, a "Run" button should be visible.
- Once the user clicks "Run", there should be **two output sections displayed side by side** for comparison:

  Part 1:
  - The output should be the JSON result from the OCR, beautified.
  - Each card should be shown in a clear format:
    Example:
    card1: "the text of card 1",
    card2: "the text of card 2",
    ...

  Part 2:
  - The output should be the result from the LLM, displayed with the same format:
    card1: "LLM result for card 1",
    card2: "LLM result for card 2",
    ...

Second Flow:
- The user should also be able to click on "Search in our database".
- In this case, the output should come from `string_matcher.py`.

Additional Instructions:
- Use and refactor the **provided model and code** to build this web app.
- The application should integrate the existing functionality within the given files, adapting them as necessary for a web interface.

Notes:
- No databases need to be used.
- Once the page is refreshed, all uploaded data and results should be reset.
